# WS Challenge Windsurf Rules

## Context and Source of Truth
- Before substantial implementation changes, review the latest PRD context.
- Keep `ChallengeOverview.md` and `FinancialPlanningAgent.md` aligned with implemented behavior.
- If guidance conflicts, follow the latest PRD text provided by the user in-session.

## Writing and Communication
- Keep language simple and direct.
- Do not use em dashes.
- Prefer short sentences and concrete examples.
- When data is missing, state assumptions explicitly.

## Product and Domain Constraints
- Keep all guidance Canada-specific.
- Handle TFSA, RRSP, FHSA, HBP, debt APR trade-offs, and CRA contribution room constraints accurately.
- Respect v1 out-of-scope boundaries (no live bank integrations, no portfolio management, no tax filing workflows).

## Human and AI Boundary
- AI can explain, prioritize, and teach.
- AI cannot execute, initiate, or recommend executing transactions.
- Every actionable step must be presented as a human decision.

## Implementation Standards
- Use deterministic calculators for payoff projections, contribution room math, cash flow allocation, and opportunity cost.
- Keep recommendations tied to user numbers, not generic advice.
- Keep default plan output at grade 8 readability.
- For household plans, support spouse-aware account prioritization and explanation.

## UX and Flow Expectations
- Include prep checklist before intake.
- Include individual vs household branch before intake.
- Preserve intake progress visibility.
- Use visible reasoning trace during plan generation.
- Include comprehension check after plan reveal.
- Include explicit action confirmation.
- Support return check-in with plan regeneration.

## Final Quality Pass
Before marking work complete, verify:
1. Challenge fit and required human/AI boundary
2. Plain language and no em dashes
3. Quantified outputs where claims are numeric
4. Clear scale risks and mitigations where relevant
5. Consistency across UI copy, agent outputs, and written explanation
