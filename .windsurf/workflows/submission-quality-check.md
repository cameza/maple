# Submission Quality Check Workflow

Run this workflow before recording the demo or finalizing written output.

1. Verify challenge requirements are covered:
   - Human role is clear
   - AI carries real cognitive responsibility
   - One critical human-only decision is explicitly justified
2. Verify the 9-screen journey is represented in product flow.
3. Verify plan output has all 3 layers with progressive disclosure.
4. Verify recommendations are tied to user numbers and use plain language.
5. Verify no transaction execution language is present.
6. Verify deterministic calculations back all math-heavy claims.
7. Verify out-of-scope items are not implied as implemented.
8. Verify scale failure mode and mitigation are stated.
9. Verify writing quality:
   - Simple language
   - No em dashes
   - No unnecessary jargon
10. Verify consistency across:
   - App behavior
   - Demo script
   - Written explanation
