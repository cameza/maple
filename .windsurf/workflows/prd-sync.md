# PRD Sync Workflow

Use this workflow at the start of a feature, major refactor, or prompt rewrite.

1. Read latest PRD source and capture changed constraints.
2. Extract acceptance criteria for the specific task.
3. Compare criteria against local docs (`ChallengeOverview.md`, `FinancialPlanningAgent.md`) and active implementation files.
4. List drift or conflicts in a short checklist.
5. Update implementation notes with explicit assumptions for missing data.
6. Confirm the human/AI boundary is visible in the user flow.
7. Confirm v1 scope boundaries are preserved.
8. Proceed only after unresolved questions are listed.
