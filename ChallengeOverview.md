## The Challenge Brief

> "Design and prototype an AI system that meaningfully expands what a human can do."

This might mean:
- Rebuilding a legacy workflow
- Handling far more complexity or serving far more people
- Making higher-quality decisions
- Operating reliably in situations that were previously impractical

### System Requirements

Your prototype must:
1. **Clearly define the human's role**
2. **Take on real cognitive or operational responsibility** — the AI must actually *do* something
   non-trivial, not just assist
3. **Explicitly name one critical decision that must remain human — and explain why**

---

## What to Submit

> No decks. No résumés.

1. **Demo video (2–3 minutes)** — Show the system *actually working*
2. **Short written explanation (max 500 words)** covering:
   - What the human can now do that they couldn't before
   - What AI is responsible for
   - Where AI must stop
   - What would break first at scale
3. **Salary expectation** + **years of hands-on experience with AI tools or systems**

## How Submissions Are Evaluated

Wealthsimple evaluates for:

- **Sound judgment** — does the system hold up in the real world, not just a demo?
- **Real problem selection** — is the problem genuine and meaningful?
- **Clear human/AI boundary** — is there a principled reason for where the line is drawn?
- **Meaningful AI responsibility** — does the AI carry actual cognitive or operational load?
- **Systems thinking** — how do you handle uncertainty, failure modes, and scale?
- **Communication** — can you explain your reasoning clearly?
- **AI-first thinking** — is this rebuilt from scratch as AI-native, or just AI bolted onto
  an old workflow?

---

## Rules & Guidelines

- You **can and are expected to** use AI tools to build your submission
- You do **not** need to know how Wealthsimple works internally
- If something is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and state it explicitly
- Must be 18+ and legally authorized to work in your current location
- Submissions are used solely for evaluation; all materials are deleted 60 days after
  the hiring process closes
- All candidates hear back regardless of outcome
