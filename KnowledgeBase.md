# AI Financial Planning Coach Knowledge Base (Canada)

This knowledge base is for Canadian users who want clear, practical guidance without jargon. Most people were never taught this in school. That is not your fault.

## 1) TFSA

**Plain-language definition**
- A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a registered account where investment growth and withdrawals are tax-free.
- You can hold cash, GICs, mutual funds, ETFs, and stocks inside it.
- You do not get a tax deduction when you contribute, but you also do not pay tax when you withdraw.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- TFSA is usually the most flexible account for medium and long-term goals because withdrawals are tax-free and can be re-contributed later.
- It is often the default first investing account when RRSP tax deductions are less valuable for the user.

**Key numbers / rules**
- 2026 annual TFSA contribution limit: **$7,000**.
- Lifetime TFSA room by Jan 1, 2026 for someone eligible every year since 2009 and never contributed: **$109,000**.
- Unused room carries forward forever.
- Withdrawals create new room, but that room comes back on **January 1 of the next calendar year**, not immediately.
- Over-contributions are penalized at **1% per month** on the excess amount.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You have $18,000 of TFSA room and a stable surplus. I can show a monthly contribution target, but you choose the amount and when to move money."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 2) RRSP

**Plain-language definition**
- A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is a registered account designed mainly for retirement savings.
- Contributions can reduce your taxable income, which can lower your tax bill.
- Money grows tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as income later.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- RRSP can be very powerful when your current tax bracket is high.
- The plan needs to compare "tax deduction value now" versus flexibility and future tax implications.

**Key numbers / rules**
- New annual room is generally **18% of prior-year earned income**, up to CRA yearly maximum.
- RRSP contribution deadline for tax year N is usually the **first 60 days** of year N+1.
- RRSP deduction value depends on your **marginal tax rate**. Higher bracket usually means bigger immediate tax benefit.
- By **December 31 of the year you turn 71**, RRSP must be converted (for example to RRIF or annuity) or withdrawn.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "Your income puts part of your earnings in a higher tax bracket, so RRSP contributions may create a stronger tax refund. You decide whether to prioritize that benefit this year."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 3) FHSA

**Plain-language definition**
- The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) helps first-time home buyers save for a qualifying home.
- Contributions are tax-deductible like an RRSP, and qualified withdrawals for a home purchase are tax-free like a TFSA.
- It combines the best parts of RRSP and TFSA for eligible buyers.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- For eligible first-time buyers, FHSA is often top priority because it gives both deduction and tax-free qualified withdrawal.
- It can change account sequencing and speed up a down payment plan.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Annual contribution limit: **$8,000**.
- Lifetime FHSA contribution limit: **$40,000**.
- Unused room can carry forward, but only up to **$8,000** into a future year.
- Maximum room available in one year is generally **$16,000** (current year $8,000 plus up to $8,000 carry-forward).
- You can use FHSA and HBP together if eligible and if withdrawals meet each program's rules.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/first-home-savings-account.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You plan to buy in 3 years and qualify as a first-time buyer. The plan can put FHSA first in your monthly savings order, with you approving each contribution target."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 4) RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

**Plain-language definition**
- The Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) lets eligible first-time buyers withdraw money from their RRSP to buy or build a qualifying home.
- You do not pay tax at withdrawal if you follow HBP rules.
- You must repay the withdrawn amount back to your RRSP over time.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- HBP can increase available down payment funds, but it creates a future repayment obligation.
- The plan must include repayment cash flow so users do not accidentally create extra taxable income later.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Current withdrawal limit is **$60,000 per person** for eligible withdrawals after April 16, 2024.
- Older limit was **$35,000** under prior rules.
- Standard repayment period is **15 years**.
- Annual required repayment is generally **1/15** of the withdrawn amount.
- If you do not repay the required amount in a year, the shortfall is added to taxable income.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/home-buyers-plan.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "If you use $40,000 through HBP, the plan can show your annual minimum repayment target. You choose how aggressively to repay beyond that minimum."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 5) Registered account priority order

**Plain-language definition**
- Priority order means deciding which registered account gets your next dollar first.
- There is no universal order for everyone. It depends on home-buying status, tax bracket, flexibility needs, and debt.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- The same contribution amount can produce very different outcomes depending on account order.
- Correct sequencing improves after-tax growth and keeps money usable for near-term goals.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Typical base order when eligible to buy first home: **FHSA first**, then RRSP or TFSA depending on tax bracket and flexibility needs.
- RRSP tends to gain priority when user is in a higher marginal tax bracket and expects a lower bracket later.
- TFSA is often flexible default when income is lower, cash flow is uncertain, or near-term access is needed.
- High-interest debt (for example credit card near 20% APR) usually outranks long-term investing contributions.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/personalfin.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You are a first-time buyer with FHSA room and a moderate tax bracket, so the proposed order is FHSA, then TFSA. You can override this if flexibility is more important to you."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 6) Pay Yourself First

**Plain-language definition**
- Pay Yourself First means you save or invest at the start of each pay cycle, not just whatever is left at month end.
- It turns saving into a default habit instead of a willpower decision.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- This rule improves consistency, which is usually more important than perfect optimization.
- It reduces the chance that all surplus is absorbed by lifestyle spending.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Operational rule in this agent: allocate savings and investing targets before guilt-free spending.
- Start with a realistic fixed amount or percent so the habit sticks.
- Increase contribution rate gradually as income rises or debt falls.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/savings-investments/savings-101.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "Based on your pay cycle, the plan suggests a same-day transfer to savings each payday. You confirm the amount and execute it yourself."

**Book reference**
- **The Richest Man in Babylon, George S. Clason**. Core idea: keep a portion of every dollar you earn.

## 7) 4-Bucket Allocation Framework

**Plain-language definition**
- The 4-bucket framework splits take-home pay into Fixed Costs, Investments, Savings, and Guilt-Free Spending.
- It gives a simple structure so money has a job before it is spent.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- It gives immediate visibility into whether spending is sustainable.
- It also provides a clean way to rebalance when one category is crowding out priorities.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Fixed Costs target: **50% to 60%** of take-home pay.
- Investments target: about **10%**.
- Savings target: about **5% to 10%**.
- Guilt-Free Spending: remainder after the first three buckets.
- Calculation method: `bucket amount = take-home pay x target %`.
- If Fixed Costs are above 60%, the plan first reduces fixed commitments or temporarily scales discretionary buckets.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/budgeting.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "Your fixed costs are 68% of take-home pay. The plan can show which fixed categories are pushing it up and suggest a rebalance path that you choose to implement."

**Book reference**
- **I Will Teach You to Be Rich, Ramit Sethi**. Core idea: use conscious spending and automatic systems.

## 8) Debt avalanche vs snowball

**Plain-language definition**
- Debt avalanche means paying extra toward the highest interest debt first while making minimums on others.
- Debt snowball means paying extra toward the smallest balance first for faster psychological wins.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- Avalanche usually saves more total interest.
- Snowball can improve follow-through for users who need momentum from early wins.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Avalanche is usually mathematically optimal for total interest cost.
- Snowball can be behavior-optimal if motivation and consistency are the user's main risks.
- Agent decision rule: use user profile plus adherence signals. If user repeatedly misses plan targets, switch to simpler momentum-first strategy.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You said quick wins keep you motivated, and your past payoff attempts stalled. The plan can use snowball first, then transition to avalanche once you build momentum."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 9) Credit card minimum payment trap

**Plain-language definition**
- Credit card minimum payments are designed to keep accounts current, not to eliminate debt quickly.
- If you only pay the minimum, interest keeps compounding and repayment can take many years.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- This is often the highest guaranteed financial drag in a user's plan.
- Paying in full monthly can immediately stop purchase interest and free cash flow for goals.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Example assumptions for transparent math:
  - Starting balance: **$3,000**
  - APR: **19.99%**
  - Monthly rate: `0.1999 / 12 = 1.6658%`
  - Payment rule: **2.5% of balance, minimum $10**, no new purchases
- Deterministic result under those assumptions:
  - Time to payoff: **307 months** (about **25.6 years**)
  - Total interest paid: about **$5,456.56**
  - Total paid: about **$8,456.56**
- Paying full statement balance by due date avoids purchase interest on new spending.
- Consistent on-time full payments support stronger credit history over time.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-cards/pay-credit-card-balance.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "At your current minimum-only path, this debt can last decades. I can show a faster payoff schedule, and you choose the monthly extra payment."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 10) Emergency fund

**Plain-language definition**
- An emergency fund is cash set aside for unexpected events like job loss, urgent travel, or a major repair.
- It protects you from using high-interest debt when life gets expensive.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- Without this buffer, one surprise expense can break the whole plan.
- It creates stability so long-term investing can continue during stress.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Target range: **3 to 6 months of essential expenses**.
- "Essential expenses" usually include rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, transportation, minimum debt payments, and essential healthcare.
- Account type: high-interest savings account (HISA), or TFSA-HISA if room exists and funds remain liquid.
- Agent trigger to shift harder into investing: user has at least **3 months** essential expenses saved and no high-interest revolving debt.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/savings-investments/emergency-funds.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You currently have one month saved. The plan can prioritize emergency fund contributions first, then increase investing after you hit three months."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 11) Over-contribution penalties (TFSA and RRSP)

**Plain-language definition**
- Over-contribution means adding more than your allowed room to a registered account.
- CRA can apply monthly penalties until the excess is removed or absorbed by new room.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- Penalties can erase the benefits of registered accounts.
- This often happens when users spread accounts across multiple institutions and lose track of total contributions.

**Key numbers / rules**
- TFSA excess contribution tax: **1% per month** on the highest excess amount in the month.
- RRSP excess contribution tax: **1% per month** on excess above the **$2,000 lifetime grace amount**.
- Common TFSA error: withdrawing and re-contributing in the same calendar year without available room.
- Best practice: verify room in **CRA My Account** before large contributions.

**Authoritative source link**
- TFSA: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html
- RRSP: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You hold TFSAs at two institutions. The plan can ask for total year-to-date contributions across both before suggesting any next deposit."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 12) Compound interest and opportunity cost

**Plain-language definition**
- Compound growth means your money can earn returns, and then those returns can also earn returns.
- Opportunity cost means what you miss out on when money is not used in a productive way.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- It helps users see the real cost of delaying contributions.
- It turns abstract advice into a measurable trade-off.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Example: investing **$6,000 per year** at **7%** for **20 years** gives about **$245,972.95**.
- In that example, personal contributions are **$120,000** and growth is about **$125,972.95**.
- Formula used for yearly contributions: `FV = P x [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]`.
- Unused registered room can be framed as deferred tax-advantaged growth.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/learning-path/investing-basics/how-compound-growth-works/

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "If you leave $6,000 of TFSA room unused this year, the plan can show the long-term growth gap so you can decide if delaying is worth it."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.

## 13) Behaviour and money psychology

**Plain-language definition**
- People are not robots with money. Emotions and habits affect decisions as much as math.
- Common patterns include present bias (favoring now), loss aversion (feeling losses strongly), and status spending (spending to signal success).

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- A plan that ignores behavior usually fails, even if the numbers look perfect.
- Better plans are realistic, shame-free, and easy to repeat.

**Key numbers / rules**
- Reframe high-interest debt payoff as a near-guaranteed return equal to avoided interest cost.
- Favor "start now, improve later" over waiting for a perfect setup.
- Use small defaults, auto-rules, and visible milestones to support consistency.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-wellness-work.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You said you feel overwhelmed and avoid looking at balances. The plan can start with one tiny weekly action and a short check-in so progress feels manageable."

**Book reference**
- **The Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel**. Core idea: long-term financial success is mostly behavior, not raw intelligence.

## 14) Financial Levels framework (Level 1 to Level 5)

**Plain-language definition**
- The Financial Levels framework is a simple ladder that shows where a user is now and what comes next.
- Each level focuses on one practical jump in stability, then one jump in growth.

**Why it matters in a financial plan**
- It makes progress visible and reduces confusion about priorities.
- It gives users one clear next target instead of trying to fix everything at once.

**Key numbers / rules**
- **Level 1**: no emergency fund, high-interest debt, no registered accounts.
- **Level 2**: credit card paid in full monthly, starter emergency fund ($1,000 to $2,000), at least one registered account open.
- **Level 3**: 3-month emergency fund, high-interest debt cleared, regular registered contributions.
- **Level 4**: 6-month emergency fund, all non-mortgage debt cleared, FHSA and RRSP contributions at target pace.
- **Level 5**: fully funded emergency fund, debt-free except optional mortgage, registered accounts maxed annually or on track.
- Agent requirement: always state current level and exact conditions to reach next level.

**Authoritative source link**
- https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-toolkit.html

**How the agent uses this**
- Example: "You are at Level 2. To reach Level 3, your next milestones are growing emergency savings from $1,500 to 3 months of essentials and finishing your high-interest debt payoff plan."

**Book reference**
- Not applicable.
